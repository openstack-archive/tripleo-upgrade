    - ANSIBLE0007  # Using command rather than an argument to e.g file
    # we have a lot of 'rm' command and we should use file module instead
    - ANSIBLE0010  # Package installs should not use latest.
    # Sometimes we need to update some packages.

    - ANSIBLE0016  # Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
    # this requires refactoring roles, skipping for now
