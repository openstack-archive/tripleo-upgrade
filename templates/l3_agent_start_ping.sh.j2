# NOTE: the &>> is necessary as if we don't redirect both
# stdout and stderr we will make any script using this one to
# hang until ping finishes. Meaning if some script crashes
# and should fail in CI it will get stuck if we don't redirect
# both outputs.
# bash
#    \ bash <script>
#    \ &| awk blah
# If script runs l3 start test and than runs something that fails
# we will make the awk wait until this ping exits as it will hold
# the output pipes. So again &>> instead of >> is necessary.
